## FAQs
#### Why use HashCards when I can just keep using other platforms?
A: HashCards strives to be the best platform for creating flash cards and studying them by providing a clean, user-friendly, and minimalistic (yet full-featured) interface. It is also the best platform for math flashcards due to its unique math equation capabilities. We don't trick our users by paywalling or limiting existing features. We believe in the potential of open development. Using HashCards should be frictionless and non-distracting. If it's not, make sure to [let me know](#support-and-feedback)!

#### How can I make a HashCards set?
A: It's easy! Just [sign up for an account here](https://hashcards.net/register), then clcik "New". From there, the editor is quite user-friendly and will automatically save your work as you go.

#### What about my data? Can I import and export?
A: HashCards supports [importing sets from other sites such as Quizlet](https://hashcards.net/learn/import). You can also export HashCards sets individually, and request a copy of all of your data.

#### Can I use HashCards' code or parts of it for my own purposes?
Currently, HashCards is not licensed. Therefore, the code falls under "All rights reserved", meaning that you cannot make copies/distribute it. However, I plan to add a license in the future. The reason there is no license yet is because I do not want another entity to be able to commercialize HashCards, and I have not found a license that aligns with this yet.
